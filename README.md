# Welcome to my portfolio site

This is the home for Biswaraj Kar's professional profile (https://biswarajkar.github.io/), which I am constantly updating.
I am working on the site at this moment and will be uploading the final version soon.

### Work In Progress
The work in progress page is built using a theme for Bootstrap created by Start Bootstrap.
Start Bootstrap is based on the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) framework created by [Mark Otto](https://twitter.com/mdo) and [Jacob Thorton](https://twitter.com/fat).
